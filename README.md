This may be a random site, but this is actually a site that you can actually have fun at school.

You can play Unblocked Games in this website like any other website like Classroom 6x.
But this website does not have power to not get blocked by the school
SO KEEP THIS A SECRET
YOU can help this website not get blocked by following these steps.
1. DO NOT SHARE THIS WEBSITE TO EVERY FRIEND YOU HAVE! They may pass it on to someone else and potentially get this website blocked.
2. DO NOT GO IN THIS WEBSITE NEAR A TEACHER! Do not open this site in class time. Or when you are sitting close to the teacher. You will get in trouble and this website could be in risk of being blocked.
BUT! If you go to some afterschool program and the teachers there are chill, you are allowed to be on the website. But if your friend goes to the same afterschool program as you, try to hide the URL of this website as best as you can.
3. ALWAYS HIDE THE URL! An example of hiding the URL is replace the URL with some random text or put an existing website URL and click anywhere will make it so it looks like the website is just random text.
So keep in mind that, if you want to have fun, don't spoil it.
